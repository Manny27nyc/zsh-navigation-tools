# Zsh Visual Tools

An alternative approach to visual shell, when compared to Midnight Commander. The command line is the main way the shell is used. From that mode of operation, user call tools that do not require mouse or typing, only navigating. Good example is zsh's AUTO_PUSHD feature. When user displays the directory stack to find the past directory that he would like to return into, he normally has to enter the directory path or invoke popd multiple times. With v1cd, only a few cursor key pushes are needed.

v1env does the same for environment. User is presented with a browsable list of environment variables and only navigation with cursor keys is needed to start editing a variable.
